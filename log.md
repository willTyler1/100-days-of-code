# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--- ### Day 0: 11th October, 2021 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: Mon 11th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Two leetcode problems in Python.

**Thoughts**: I haven't touched python in ~6 months, it was fun remembering syntax and writing some easy algorithms.

### Day 2: Tues 12th October, 2021

**Today's Progress**: FreeCodeCamp scientific computing in python - polygon area project.

**Thoughts**: Did the polygon area project, managed to get all unit tests to pass. Will maybe neaten rest of code. Python memory is coming back :D

### Day 3: Weds 13th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp budget calc project.

**Thoughts**: Started a little late in the evening so my brain was pretty tired, still managed to write and test a decent chunk of the code. It feels good to be writing some python again, I will probably do a few more of the FreeCodeCamp projects before starting some other stuff.

### Day 4: Thurs 14th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Finished most of FreeCodeCamp budget calc project.

**Thoughts**: Essentially finished, having some issues with the create spend chart format.

### Day 5: Fri 15th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed format for create_spend_chart in FreeCodeCamp budget calc project.

**Thoughts**: The code for this function could definitely be neater, but at least it works now :D.

### Day 6: Sat 16th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Read about computation expressions in F#.

**Thoughts**: These are something I've seen others talking about but I have yet to use (and so don't understand!), still need to figure them out properly and make some notes.

### Day 7: Sun 17th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started the leetcode algorithms 1 Series of problems.

**Thoughts**: Did all three Day 1 problems in the series. These were all binary search algorithms - it was fun to recall binary searches, I haven't seen those since decision maths A level!

### Day 8: Mon 18th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Leetcode algos 1 day2 problems .

**Thoughts**: Did the day 2 problems in the series. These were all "two pointer" problems. I.e. problems where you have two index points that converge to a common point (at which point the problem is solved).

### Day 9: Tues 19th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Leetcode algos 1 day3 problems.

**Thoughts**: Did the day 3 problems in the series (again, both 2 pointer problems). Also did another random problem (Next greater element), need to optimise the code for this though as my solution is quite slow.
