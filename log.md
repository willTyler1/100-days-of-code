# 100 Days Of Code - Log

<!--- ### Day 0: 11th October, 2021 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Today's Progress**: Two leetcode problems in Python.

**Thoughts**: I haven't touched python in ~6 months, it was fun remembering syntax and writing some easy algorithms.

### Day 3: Mon 13th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Started FreeCodeCamp budget calc project.

**Thoughts**: Started a little late in the evening so my brain was pretty tired, still managed to write and test a decent chunk of the code. It feels good to be writing some python again, I will probably do a few more of the FreeCodeCamp projects before starting some other stuff.

### Day 5: Mon 15th October, 2021 

**Today's Progress**: Fixed format for create_spend_chart in FreeCodeCamp budget calc project.
